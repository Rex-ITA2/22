            Chocolate ice cream flavor introduction
        </h1>
        
            
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to making a silky smoothie ice cream is to balance the ratio of cream to sugar and add just the right amount of egg yolk and milk. Whip air or use an ice cream maker to add softness. 
            
             <br>
            Accurate temperature measurement helps control quality. No ice cream maker needed, just freeze. The finished product is fragrant and delicate, not greasy or sweet, absolutely delicious.
